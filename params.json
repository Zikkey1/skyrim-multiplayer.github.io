{"name":"Skyrim Multiplayer","tagline":"","body":"Skyrim Multiplayer (SkyMP) is a modification for Skyrim SE allowing to play online.\r\n\r\n< DOWNLOAD BUTTON >\r\n\r\n# Goals\r\n\r\n- Stable, full playable coop-mode with working main quest.\r\n- DLC and global modifications support (like Beyond Skyrim).\r\n- Support as many players in a single world as possible (up to 1000).\r\n- Plugin system that allows writing clientside and serverside extensions in JavaScript/TypeScript. It would allow server owners to implement unique game mechanics (guilds, factions, jobs, combat or social interaction between players, etc). Possibilities would be limited only by your programming skills.\r\n- Emulate Bethesda's Papyrus-based scripting system on the server-side to synchronize things written in Papyrus like ore mining, nirnroots, some animals, etc.\r\n- Embedded anticheat, for opening public servers without fear of cheaters.\r\n- Chromium Embedded Framework for displaying implemented from scratch interfaces like chat, party, admin panel, guild panel, minigames, or whatever you can imagine. This will make it possible to use modern Web technologies in Skyrim.\r\n\r\n# State of the project\r\n\r\nYou are free to download our game client and play public servers or host your own. 0 users are playing on 0 servers right now.\r\n### Multiplayer Stats\r\n< Monitoring link >\r\n\r\nCurrent users per server limit equals 30.\r\nSupported server platforms: Windows.\r\nAutoupdate: Not implemented, for now, you need to update client files manually.\r\nSynchronizations Starter Pack (selected means available now):\r\n - [x] Movement\r\n - [x] Animation events\r\n - [ ] Appearance <==== We are here\r\n - [ ] Names\r\n - [ ] Equipment\r\n - [ ] Inventory\r\n - [ ] Actor Values (Health, Magicka, Stamina, etc)\r\n - [ ] Melee damage (PvP)\r\n - [ ] Death\r\n\r\n# Donations\r\nYou can support us via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/skymp).\r\nThis would allow our team to spend less time on the real-world jobs and more time in attempts to synchronize butterflies' trajectory.

We are comfortable working privately as a small team. But obviously, we will be publishing API to be used freely to keep our community decentralized and fill Skyrim of different game modes.
